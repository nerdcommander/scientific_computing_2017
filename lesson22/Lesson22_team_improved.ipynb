    "In the simulation of the random motion of many particles in a box, we did not care about their positions – all we needed to know was the number of particles on each side.  Suppose that we want to characterize the motion of a dust particle in the atmosphere or a pollen grain suspended in water.  We know that as a given dust particle collides with molecules in the atmosphere, it changes its direction frequently, and its motion appears to be random. A simple model for the trajectory of a dust particle in the atmosphere is based on the assumption that the particle moves in any direction with equal probability - this is a model is an example of a random walk. \n",

    "Consider an idealized/simplified example of a random walker that can move only along a line (in 1 dimension).  Suppose that the walker begins at $x = 0$ and that each step is of equal length.  At each time interval the walker has a probability $p$ of a step to the right and a probability $q = 1− p$ of a step to the left. The direction of each step is independent of the preceding one.  The final position of the walker (or the displacement of the walker from the origin) after $N$ steps is:  \n",

    "For example, if $p=0.5$, a step to the right ($s = +1$) will occur $50%$ of the time.  This does not mean, however, that the walker will move to the right every other step - each step is independent, like a coin flip.  Overall, after many trials, we expect a step to the right to happen half the time and a step to the left ($s = -1$) the other half, but there is a finite possibility of moving right five times in a row (think about how you would calculate this probability given $p=0.5$).  \n",
