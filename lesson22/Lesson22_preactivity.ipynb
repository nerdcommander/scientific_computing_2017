    "Suppose that we want to characterize the motion of a dust particle in the atmosphere or a pollen grain suspended in water. We know that as a given dust particle collides with molecules in the atmosphere, it changes its direction frequently, and its motion appears to be random. A simple model for the trajectory of a dust particle in the atmosphere is based on the assumption that the particle moves in any direction with equal probability. Such a model is an example of a random walk. \n",
