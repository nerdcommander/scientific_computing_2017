    "The **Monte Carlo (MC)** method is a way to approximate solutions to a variety of mathematical problems by conducting statistical sampling experiments on a computer. In other words, this method relies on random sampling to obtain numerical results. This technique was named after a city in Monaco where the roulette wheel was used essentially as a random number generator.  You can find MC methods used in everything from economics to modeling molecules to regulating the flow of traffic.  Although the way MC algorithms are applied varies widely from field to field, all \"Monte Carlo\" experiments use random numbers to examine some problem.\n"
