    "The Nernst Equation is used to describe the ***equilibrium potential*** of an ion ($E_{ion}$), which is the voltage at which the net flow of a particular ion would be zero. It depends on several factors and is described below:  \n",
    "$$E_{ion}= - \\frac{RT}{zF}ln\\left (\\frac{[ion]_{in}}{[ion]_{out}} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $z$ is the valence of the ion (including the charge), $ln$ is the natural log (log base $e$), and $[ion]_{in}$ and $[ion]_{out}$ are the concentration of the ion inside and outside of the cell respectively.   \n",
    "$R$ is the gas constant \n",
    "$T$ is the temperature in Kelvin  \n",

    "One convenient thing, is that at $37^oC$ the term $RT/F$ can be calculated and used as a constant: $RT/F= 26.73mV$  \n",

    "$$E_{ion}= - \\frac{26.73mV}{z}ln\\left (\\frac{[ion]_{in}}{[ion]_{out}} \\right)$$\n",
