    "Many problems require that we count the number of ways that a particular event can occur. In mathematics, combinatorial analysis is the theoretical framework that we use to understand the number of different possible arrangements of given things or elements.  It is the basis of entropy, which can be viewed as the number of ways a system can be configured.  Combinatorial methods are used to explain the evolutionary history of a set of species by accounting for multiple combinations of genes or DNA sequences in observed genomes.  This overall idea is also used as a tool to identify and synthesize a large number of chemical compounds to be tested for potential drug candidates (this is called combinatorial chemistry)."

    "As an example, there are evolutionary processes that result in the shuffling of genes (rearranging the order - like cards). This takes a long time in the evolution of most species, but is evolutionarily fast in viruses. Gene or DNA shuffling is also used in the lab to generate new versions of viral protein capsids to make vaccines especially in viruses that have many variations or types (like flu).  \n",

    "Before we get into genes, let's start with a card example. Let's say that you have a normal, complete deck of playing cards with the usual 52 cards that you want to deal cards to someone and you're going to keep track of the order.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you deal the first card, there are 52 possibilities, but when you go to deal the second card there are only 51 cards left so there are 51 possible outcomes. So how many possible outcomes are there for the 2 cards (the order matters and we are sampling the cards _without replacement_, which is the definition of _permutation_)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we could start counting the number of arrangements, but that's too slow and we're \"lazy\" scientists. The axioms of probability theory tell us that we need to multiply these 2 numbers to get the number of different permutations of cards. So there are $52 \\times 51 = 2652$ possible permutations of 2 cards (keeping track of order).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then when you deal the third care, there are ony 50 possible cards left, so there are $52 \\times 51 \\times 50 = 132600$ possible permutations of 2 cards (keeping track of order). This number is getting large fast! If we deal another card, etc. etc. - but rather than doing the math long hand, let's think of an easier method.\n"
