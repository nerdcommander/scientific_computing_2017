    "In the previous lesson, we selected a particle at random and moved it to the other side.  This procedure, however, is cumbersome, because we need to keep track of the position of all $N$ particles. We can simplify our algorithm by realizing our only interest is the number of particles on each side. Actually, we only need to know $n_{left}$, the number of particles on the left side, since the number on the right side is the difference, $N−n_{left}$. Because each particle has the same likelihood of going through the hole, the probability per unit time that a particle moves from left to right equals the number of particles on the left side divided by the total number of particles, so the probability of a move from left to right is: $$\\frac{n_{left}}{N}$$ \n",
