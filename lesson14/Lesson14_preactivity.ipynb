    "There has been a lot of disussion lately in the scientific community and the [media](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/) about a \"reproducibility crisis\" in science. Two relatively high profile examples over the years in [medicine](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124) and [psychology](science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716.full) have really led the way in making the case for **\"Reproducible Research\"** but there is a strong argument for being able to reproduce lots of different kinds of [computational science](https://psychology.stanford.edu/sites/all/files/Science-2011-Peng-1226-7.pdf) (including [computational biology](https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12918-016-0288-x) - this one even talks about Jupyter Notebooks). Hopefully your science professors and mentors have impressed upon you the long tradition of scientific note taking, this idea extends to more complex analysis of complex data.\n",
