    "In any scientific investigation, it all starts with the data.  You may call them a set of results, or a sample, or events, but whatever the name, they consist of a set of basic measurements from which you are trying to extract meaningful information.  Statistics is a tool used to describe data in a meaningful way.  In this lesson, various descriptive statistics and calculations are introduced that are used to analyze and interpret the results of an experiment.  \n",

    "For our convenience, we will be using the equations for variance based on what we refer to as a \"finite population\". This means that we have a small number of observations and they represent our whole population, rather than our data representing a sample from a much larger population where we then use the sample to estimate the variance for a larger population. For samples from a larger population, the first term in the equations for variance below (Eq 2-4, all starting with $V(x)$) would have to be $\\frac{1}{N-1}$. If you are in biology or neuroscience, you will be more familiar with the $\\frac{1}{N-1}$ versions since we are nearly always using a random(ish) sample to estimate population parameters and the $\\frac{1}{N-1}$ versions give a more conservative (hopefully less biased) estimate of the variance. Two contexts where the $\\frac{1}{N}$ versions are used are when precision of a set of measurements is being estimated, as in the Pre-Activity Questions below, and if you wanted the variance of a set of class grades but where not going to make any inference about them or compare them to any other class. If you have never taken statistics, you don't need to worry about this now, just use the equations given."
